Currently a WIP terrain generator. The idea is to have a basic, free terrain editor as a lightweight alternatives to [https://www.world-creator.com/](WorldCreator) and [WorldMachine](https://www.world-machine.com/). It's in an experimental state and may or may not get finished. Here's the latest screenshot that shows the look and feel of the program.
